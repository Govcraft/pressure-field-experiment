\section{Experimental Protocol}

This appendix provides complete reproducibility information for all experiments.

\subsection{Hardware and Software}

\textbf{Hardware:} NVIDIA RTX 4070 8GB \ac{gpu}, AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS, 64GB RAM

\textbf{Software:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rust 1.75+ (edition 2024)
\item Ollama (local \ac{llm} inference server)
\item Models: \texttt{qwen2.5:0.5b}, \texttt{qwen2.5:1.5b}, \texttt{qwen2.5:3b}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Configuration}

Models are served via Ollama with a system prompt configured for schedule optimization:

\begin{lstlisting}
You optimize meeting room schedules. Given a schedule with gaps or conflicts,
propose ONE change: move, swap, or reschedule a meeting to reduce gaps,
overlaps, and utilization variance. Return ONLY your proposed change
in the format: MOVE meeting_id TO room day start_time
\end{lstlisting}

For multi-model setups (model escalation), models share a single Ollama instance with automatic routing based on model name.

\subsection{Sampling Diversity}

The experiment framework overrides default sampling parameters with three exploration bands per \ac{llm} call:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Band} & \textbf{Temperature} & \textbf{Top-p} \\
\midrule
Exploitation & 0.15--0.35 & 0.80--0.90 \\
Balanced & 0.35--0.55 & 0.85--0.95 \\
Exploration & 0.55--0.85 & 0.90--0.98 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sampling parameter ranges. Each \acs{llm} call randomly samples from one band.}
\label{tab:sampling}
\end{table}

This diversity prevents convergence to local optima and enables exploration of the solution space.

\subsection{Baseline Implementation Details}

To ensure fair comparison, all strategies use identical \ac{llm} prompts and parsing logic. The only differences are region selection and patch validation:

\textbf{Prompt (identical across all strategies):}
\begin{lstlisting}
You are a meeting room scheduler. Output schedules in the exact format requested.

Meeting Room Schedule Optimization.
Goal: Schedule meetings to minimize gaps and avoid conflicts.

Time Block: [time range]

Rooms:
  Room A: capacity 10
  Room B: capacity 8
  ...

Current assignments:
[current schedule for this time block]

Unscheduled meetings that could fit in this block:
  Meeting 5: 60min, 4 attendees
  Meeting 12: 30min, 2 attendees
  ...

Constraints:
- No attendee can be in multiple meetings at the same time
- Room capacity must fit attendees

Output the schedule for this time block.
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Region selection per strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pressure-field}: Multiple agents select regions in parallel based on pressure gradients
\item \textbf{Hierarchical}: Always selects the single highest-pressure region
\item \textbf{Sequential}: Round-robin through regions in fixed order
\item \textbf{Random}: Uniform random region selection
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Patch validation per strategy:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pressure-field}: Validates all patches; applies only those reducing pressure
\item \textbf{Hierarchical}: Validates single patch; applies only if pressure reduces
\item \textbf{Sequential/Random}: No validation; applies any syntactically valid patch
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why ``one patch per tick'' for hierarchical?} This asymmetry is inherent to the coordination paradigm, not an implementation choice. Hierarchical control requires the manager to: (1) observe global state, (2) select a target region, (3) delegate to a worker, (4) receive the proposed patch, and (5) validate before applying. Delegating to $K$ workers simultaneously would require additional coordination protocols---work distribution to avoid conflicts, result aggregation, tie-breaking when multiple patches target overlapping state---that would transform hierarchical control into a fundamentally different architecture. The sequential bottleneck is the cost of centralized decision-making. Pressure-field avoids this overhead through stigmergic coordination: agents observe shared state independently and propose patches without central delegation, enabling natural parallelism.

\textbf{Conversation baseline implementation} The conversation baseline implements AutoGen-style multi-agent dialogue with three roles: a \emph{Coordinator} that selects which region to address, a \emph{Proposer} that suggests schedule changes, and a \emph{Validator} that critiques proposals. Each tick proceeds as follows: (1) the Coordinator identifies a high-pressure region (1 \ac{llm} call), (2) the Proposer and Validator engage in up to 5 dialogue turns (2 calls per turn), (3) if the Validator approves, the patch is applied. This yields 4--12 \ac{llm} calls per tick for a single region, compared to pressure-field's $K$ parallel calls across $K$ regions. The conversation terminates when the Validator approves or the turn limit is reached. We use fixed sampling parameters (T=0.3, top-p=0.9) for structured dialogue, lower than pressure-field's exploration bands.

\subsection{Problem Generation and Seeding}

Fair strategy comparison requires identical problem instances: each strategy must face the same scheduling challenge within a trial. We achieve this through deterministic seeding.

Each trial generates its problem from a seed:
\[
\text{seed} = \text{trial} \times 1000 + \text{agent\_count}
\]

Trial 5 with 2 agents yields seed 5002, producing identical meeting configurations whether evaluated with pressure-field, conversation, or hierarchical coordination.

The seed governs all stochastic generation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Meeting durations (1--4 time slots)
\item Attendee assignments (2--5 participants)
\item Room preferences and capacity requirements
\item Pre-scheduled vs.\ unassigned meeting distribution
\item Time slot availability patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metrics Collected}

Each experiment records:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{solved}: Boolean indicating all meetings scheduled with zero overlaps
\item \texttt{total\_ticks}: Iterations to solve (or max if unsolved)
\item \texttt{pressure\_history}: Pressure value at each tick (gaps + overlaps + util\_var + unscheduled)
\item \texttt{band\_escalation\_events}: Sampling band changes (tick, from\_band, to\_band)
\item \texttt{model\_escalation\_events}: Model tier changes (tick, from\_model, to\_model)
\item \texttt{final\_model}: Which model tier solved the schedule
\item \texttt{token\_usage}: Prompt and completion tokens consumed (pressure-field only; conversation baseline uses a different LLM client path that does not collect token statistics, precluding cross-strategy comparison)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Replication Notes}

Each configuration runs 30 independent trials with different random seeds to ensure reliability. Results report mean solve rates and tick counts across trials.

\section{Pressure Alignment Verification}
\label{app:coupling}

This appendix verifies that the meeting scheduling domain satisfies the alignment condition (Definition~2) required for convergence (Theorem~1).

\subsection{Per-Region Pressure Components}

The per-region pressure function includes three components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{gap\_ratio}: Fraction of empty slots in this time block. \emph{Strictly local}---depends only on meetings scheduled within this region.
\item \textbf{overlap\_count}: Number of attendee double-bookings within this time block. \emph{Strictly local}---the overlap sensor counts attendees with multiple meetings in \emph{this block only}, not across blocks.
\item \textbf{utilization\_variance}: Variance in room utilization within this time block. \emph{Strictly local}---measures balance across rooms for meetings in this region.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{unscheduled\_count} component is added to \emph{total} pressure only, not to per-region pressure. This design choice ensures separability.

\subsection{Coupling Analysis}

For the alignment condition, we need $|P_j(s') - P_j(s)| \leq \epsilon$ for all $j \neq i$ when modifying region $i$.

\textbf{Result}: $\epsilon = 0$ (per-region pressure is separable).

\textbf{Rationale}: All three per-region components depend only on the region's own content:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Modifying region $i$'s schedule changes which meetings occupy region $i$'s slots.
\item This affects region $i$'s gap\_ratio, overlap\_count, and utilization\_variance.
\item It has \emph{zero effect} on any other region $j$'s pressure, since $j$'s components depend only on meetings within $j$'s time slots.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Note on attendee constraints}: While the same attendee may have meetings in multiple time blocks, our overlap sensor counts overlaps \emph{within each block independently}. Moving a meeting from region $i$ to region $j$ may create or resolve overlaps in region $j$, but this is a local effect on $j$'s pressure, not a coupling effect where modifying region $i$ affects region $j$ through some indirect mechanism.

\subsection{Empirical Validation}

Analysis of 270 pressure-field trials confirms separability:
\begin{itemize}
\item Total tick-to-tick transitions analyzed: 9,873
\item Transitions with pressure improvement: 1,160 (11.7\%)
\item Transitions with pressure degradation: 0 (0.0\%)
\item Transitions with no change: 8,713 (88.3\%)
\end{itemize}

The complete absence of pressure degradation is consistent with separable pressure: each accepted patch reduces local pressure, which directly reduces global pressure without adverse effects on other regions. (Patches that would increase local pressure are rejected by validation.)

Mean improvement magnitude: 2.67 pressure units. This substantially exceeds any plausible coupling bound, confirming that local improvements reliably translate to global improvements.
